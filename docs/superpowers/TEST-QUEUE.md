# Use-the-app test queue

**Role: ACTIVE, permanent.** The `closeout` skill appends here; `session-start` reads here
and flags anything that has been sitting untested. This is the async counterpart to the
test suites — it catches the defect class that code review and mocked tests structurally
cannot.

**One entry per closeout. Newest first. Mark an entry DONE with the date and what it
found, or DONE — nothing found. Do not delete entries; the record of what was exercised is
the point.**

## QUEUED — 2026-07-22 — Phase 2 adoption (`capfix`)

**What changed.** The graph the app routes on. `cap_strategy` is now `mutual_knn` (an edge
survives only if each endpoint ranks the other in its top-k), which cuts the edge count to
roughly a fifth of the old graph. Nothing in the API or frontend changed.

**Before you can use it:** the dev graph must be rebuilt from the adopted artifact, since
`graph-5k.bin` is gitignored and was regenerated locally at closeout.

```bash
cd builder && UV_LINK_MODE=copy uv run artistpath-build fixture \
  --graph scratch/graph-t15-capfix.bin --out scratch/graph-5k.bin --size 5000
```

**What to exercise:**

1. **Ordinary paths between artists you know well.** The blind test covered this and found
   the arms mostly similar without bypass — so this is a regression check, not a discovery
   run. Two or three paths is enough.
2. **Bypass, repeatedly, on the same path.** This is the priority. It is the channel that
   decided the adoption and the one no metric covers.
3. **Search for obscure artists.** Mutual k-NN prunes hardest in the obscure tail, and the
   largest-connected-component step runs after it.

**What "wrong" would look like:**

- **A "no path" result.** This should be impossible — the graph is pruned to its largest
  connected component, so a no-path result can only come from user exclusions. If one
  appears without exclusions, that is a real defect, not a tuning question.
- **An artist that used to be searchable and is now absent.** Retention was 98.93 %, so
  roughly 800 artists did leave the graph. Expected in the aggregate; worth knowing if it
  hits someone you would actually search for.
- **Bypass failing to lengthen or diversify** across many rerolls — the failure mode the
  losing arm showed.
- Clip bugs (wrong artist, dead audio) are **known, unrelated, and live in both arms**.
  They are Phase 1's work (C1, C2). Not worth reporting again unless they look different.

**Best bug report:** the URL from the address bar. All path state lives in it
(`/path/:from/:to?dislike=…&known=…`), so it reproduces the exact path and bypasses.

**Note on scope.** The owner has already used both arms extensively in the blind test. This
entry is deliberately light: it is a post-adoption sanity check, not a repeat of that
session.
